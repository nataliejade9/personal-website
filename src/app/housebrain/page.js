We quickly reaslised that there were hidden costs and a lack of information for first-time buyers who may not have family support to explain the process. In 2024 I redesigned the product to suit and be more accessible to the target user."}

We had some very positive feedback from the client. In particular they loved the abstract space theme and thought it put accross a sophisticated aesthetic. He also really enjoyed the gamification of the rewards section, as he had a few designers look at this project and found this to be unqiue and stand out for the brand.

As we could look at incorporating referral schemes or onboarding screens that were tested on users to better achieve this result.</p>
                <p>In this project, I learnt the importance of well tested UX and wireframes before defining the UI designs and not jumping to UI too early.</p>
